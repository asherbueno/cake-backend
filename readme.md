# Project #3 - CaKe Website
## Real world application for a local organisation or business.

### Description
You are to design, build, deploy and present an application built for a real world customer. Meet with the business owner or organisation manager to find out what challenges they face. Find a problem that you can solve with an application and present your ideas to the client.

### Client Interaction
The client I engaged with was a fashion student from White House Institute of Design for a website application to showcase his work when he is finished with his course at the end of July 2017.

### Problem definition
The client wants to start a business and disrupt the fashion industry by the end of 2017. The client doesn't know where to begin and isn't technically sound.

### Solution
After discussing the problem with the client we both came to a conclusion that having an online presence would be a great first step into starting up a business by being able to gather some sort of following and hype. This would also allow the client to showcase his work.

### Requirements
A simple website that will showcase the clients creation when he finishes his design course at the end of July 2017.
Dummy data will be posted to show layout. 
### Constraints
Time: client is a student, hence he will be busy for his major project.
Content: client has no content and photos to showcase yet (still to come).
### Risks
Time: Impossibility to finish a website in just 2 weeks.

## Project Charter
### Project Scope
Produce an MVP that demonstrates how the final website will look like when completed and being able to upload images in a GUI without requiring any coding knowledge.

### Schedule
Estimated timeframe to complete the MVP is 2 weeks after 29/05/17. Possibly 60-80 hours of work.

## Post Project Review
Project is not completed to the standard I set on myself. Still needs require work. Planning to deploy for the client with no pressure on finishing.
